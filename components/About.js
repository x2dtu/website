                    supportive family and friends. I am planning to graduate with my
                    Bachelor's Degree in Spring 2023 and will stay an extra year
                    to complete my Master's in Science."

                  solving challenging problems. Naturally, when I took my first
                  computer science class in my freshman year of college, I fell in
                  love with the subject. I continue to code because it gives me the
